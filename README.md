# Covid19 Tracker ðŸ¦  [Live Demo](https://covid-19-tracker-777.netlify.app)

### Overview
This is my attempt to solve a problem I had which was having to visit 2 separate websites to track covid19 cases/deaths and vaccination rates. So I integrated these 2 functionalities into one app with the help of the Open Disease Data API
#### **Features:**
* Track global or a specific country's cases/deaths and vaccination rates data.
* You can see the data visualized in charts from.

#### **Technologies Used:**
* Vue.js, Tailwind, HTML/CSS/JavaScript[ES6+], Axios, Chart.js 

#### **Tools:**
* Visual Studio Code
* Git and GitHub
* Vue.js devtools

#### **Outcome:**
* Used `Axios` to consume the the Open Disease Data API
* Made use of my `Promises`, `Async/Await` skills 
* Learned how to manage my Vue app state in a better way
* Added a loader to the app to make the UX better and smoother
* Deepened my knowledge of using **Vue.js**, **Tailwind**, **Chart.js** and **Axios**
* Had lots of fun with the styling of the app ðŸŽ¨
